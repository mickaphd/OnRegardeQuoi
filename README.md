**OnRegardeQuoi** is a free, open-source, minimalist web app that helps you discover movies and TV shows through their trailers. It takes its name from the French phrase 'On regarde quoi ?', meaning 'What are we watching?'. The goal is to provide a simple, trailer-focused experience, not to replace more comprehensive movie databases.

    ```
3.  **Run** the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## How Content is Selected

To ensure a high-quality and relevant discovery experience, **OnRegardeQuoi** doesn't just show everything. It uses specific filters for each category, which is why the listings may differ from the main TMDB website. Here‚Äôs a look at the "secret sauce":

| Category | Content Type | Filtering Criteria | Sorted By |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **üî• Trending Now** | Movies | Released in the last **3 months**, with a rating of **‚â• 5/10** and at least **100 votes**. | Popularity |
| | TV Shows | First aired in the last **6 months**, with a rating of **‚â• 5/10** and at least **100 votes**. | Popularity |
| **üïí Coming Soon** | Movies | Premiering within the next **6 months**. | Popularity |
| | TV Shows | Premiering within the next **year**. | Popularity |
| **‚≠ê All-Time Greats** | Movies | At least **5,000 votes**. | User Rating |
| | TV Shows | At least **2,000 votes**. | User Rating |

*Note: These criteria will certainly evolve in the future!*
